P2WPKH has the same semantics as P2PKH, except that the signature is not placed at the same location as before. Segregated Witness (SegWit) moves the proof of ownership from the scriptSig part of the transaction to a new part called the witness of the input.

If all you wish to do is receive payment to an address (without multisig) it's better to use P2WPKH as it's cheaper to spend from those addresses.
