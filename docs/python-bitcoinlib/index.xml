A PR for signet has been merged but the version that supports it hasn't been released yet. Despite this section being called Transactions, it will actually show how to generate specific types of Bitcoin addresses and then make a transaction to spend the funds that each specific address type will hold.
Bitcoin doesn't actually have transaction types but has different types of addresses.</description></item></channel></rss>
