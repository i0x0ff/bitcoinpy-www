This package allows generating mnemonics, seeds, private/public keys and addresses. In particular:

- Mnemonic and seed generation as defined by BIP-0039
- Private key encryption/decryption as defined by BIP-0038
- Keys derivation as defined by BIP-0032 and SLIP-0010
- Derivation of a hierarchy of keys as defined by BIP-0044, BIP-0049 and BIP-0084

This unfortunatelly isn't a Bitcoin only library and includes supports for other cryptocurrencies.
